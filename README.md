# 📑Project Title
### Design of An Efficient Forecast Model For Too Early Parkinson’s Disease Detection    
# 📌Description
Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a progressive neurological disorder that presents symptoms similar to various other conditions, making early and accurate diagnosis a challenging task. Common symptoms include tremors, muscle stiffness, slowed movements, and balance issues. Recognizing the critical need for early detection to ensure better patient outcomes, this study explores the dynamic patterns of handwritten documents as a diagnostic marker for PD.

Traditional machine learning approaches relying on manually crafted features have shown limited accuracy and performance. To address these challenges, this work introduces an advanced deep learning model optimized for the early diagnosis of Parkinson’s disease. The proposed model leverages a genetic algorithm combined with the K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) technique for feature optimization, resulting in significantly improved predictive accuracy.

The methodology achieves detection accuracy greater than 95%, precision exceeding 98%, an area under the curve (AUC) above 0.90, and a remarkably low loss of 0.12. Additionally, an ensemble strategy integrating Tuned KNN and Random Forest classifiers achieves an unprecedented 100% accuracy, highlighting the strength of the combined approach.

This study presents a strong and innovative diagnostic tool that not only outperforms several state-of-the-art machine learning and deep learning models but also makes a substantial contribution to the field of early Parkinson’s disease detection.

## 🏗️Model Architectures Used
We experimented with multiple deep learning models:

- `VGG16`: A widely used Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture with 16 layers. It follows a simple and uniform design with small 3×3 convolution filters and is known for its high accuracy in image classification tasks.

- `ResNet50`: A 50-layer deep residual network that introduces skip connections (residual learning) to avoid the vanishing gradient problem. It allows training of very deep networks with improved performance.

- `DenseNet169`: A densely connected CNN with 169 layers, where each layer receives input from all previous layers. This promotes feature reuse and reduces the number of parameters compared to traditional deep networks.

- `DenseNet201`: A deeper variant of DenseNet with 201 layers, further improving accuracy and efficiency through better feature propagation and gradient flow.

- `Xception`: An extension of the Inception architecture that uses depthwise separable convolutions, significantly reducing computational cost while maintaining high performance. It achieved the best accuracy in our experiments.
